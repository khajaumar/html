      <h1>"The boy who cried wolf"</h1>
          <h> Once upon a time, there lived a shepherd boy who was bored watching his flock of sheep on the hill. </br>
          To amuse himself, he shouted, “Wolf! Wolf! The sheep are being chased by the wolf!” The villagers came </br>
          running to help the boy and save the sheep. They found nothing and the boy just laughed looking at their </br>
          angry faces.<hr>

          “Don’t cry ‘wolf’ when there’s no wolf boy!”, they said angrily and left. The boy just laughed at them.</br>
          After a while, he got bored and cried ‘wolf!’ again, fooling the villagers a second time. The angry villagers warned </br>
          the boy a second time and left. The boy continued watching the flock. After a while, he saw a real wolf and cried loudly,</br>
           “Wolf! Please help! The wolf is chasing the sheep. Help!” <hr>
          
           But this time, no one turned up to help. By evening, when the boy didn’t return home, the villagers wondered </br>
           what happened to him and went up the hill. The boy sat on the hill weeping. “Why didn’t you come when I called out</br>
           that there was a wolf?” he asked angrily. “The flock is scattered now”, he said.<hr>

           An old villager approached him and said, “People won’t believe liars even when they tell the truth. We’ll look </br>
           for your sheep tomorrow morning. Let’s go home now”.<hr></h>
